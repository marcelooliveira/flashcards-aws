        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Data Pipeline

      - text: Amazon CloudSearch
        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon Athena
        is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Amazon Athena is defined as "an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL." So, it's another SQL query engine for large data sets stored in S3.
      This is very similar to other SQL query engines, such as Apache Drill.
      But unlike Apache Drill, Athena is limited to data only from Amazon's own S3 storage service. However, Athena is able to query a variety of file formats, including, but not limited to CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.

    question: What is the purpose of AWS Storage Gateway?

        is_correct: false
      - text: It transports petabytes of data to and from AWS.
        is_correct: false
      - text: It connects to multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
        is_correct: false
      - text: It connects on-premises data storage to the AWS Cloud.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch.
      For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider --and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly.
      If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that).
      AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size.
      It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.
