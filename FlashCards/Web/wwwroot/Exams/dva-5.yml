    question: A company has a web application that uses an Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication. The company wants to create a login page with the company logo. What should a Developer do to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Create a hosted user interface in Amazon Cognito and customize it with the company logo.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Create a login page with the company logo and upload it to Amazon Cognito.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create a login page in Amazon API Gateway with the logo and save the link in Amazon Cognito.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Upload the logo to the Amazon Cognito app settings and point to the logo on a custom login page.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Use the Amazon Cognito hosted UI and customize it with your company logo because the hosted UI supports branding and is the supported way to present a login page managed by Cognito.
      The other options suggest uploading full custom pages to Cognito or using API Gateway for UI, which Cognito does not support; storing a logo reference in app settings is not a built-in replacement for the hosted UI.

    question: A Developer is working on an AWS Lambda function that accesses Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function must retrieve an item and update some of its attributes, or create the item if it does not exist. The Lambda function has access to the primary key. Which IAM permissions should the Developer request for the Lambda function to achieve this functionality?
    options:
     - text: 'dynamodb:DeleteItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:PutItem'
       is_correct: false
     - text: 'dynamodb:UpdateItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:DescribeTable'
       is_correct: false
     - text: 'dynamodb:GetRecords dynamodb:PutItem dynamodb:UpdateTable'
       is_correct: false
     - text: 'dynamodb:UpdateItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:PutItem'
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      The combination of GetItem, UpdateItem and PutItem allows the function to read an item, update attributes when present, and create the item if needed, covering both read and write operations.
      Other choices either lack the required update or put permissions or include unrelated actions (like DeleteItem, DescribeTable, or UpdateTable) that do not provide the necessary read-and-create workflow.

    question: A Developer is storing sensitive data generated by an application in Amazon S3. The Developer wants to encrypt the data at rest. A company policy requires an audit trail of when the master key was used and by whom. Which encryption option will meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
       is_correct: false
     - text: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS).
       is_correct: true
     - text: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).
       is_correct: false
     - text: Server-side encryption with self-managed keys.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      SSE-KMS meets the audit requirement because AWS KMS provides key usage logs and audit trails via AWS CloudTrail, showing when and by whom the CMK was used.
      SSE-S3, SSE-C, and self-managed keys do not provide the same integrated KMS audit trail and access logging for the master key usage required by the policy.

    question: A company's website runs on an Amazon EC2 instance and uses Auto Scaling to scale the environment during peak times. Website users across the world are experiencing high latency due to static content on the EC2 instance, even during non-peak hours. Which combination of steps will resolve the latency issue? (Choose TWO)
    options:
     - text: Double the Auto Scaling group's maximum number of servers.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Host the application code on AWS Lambda.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Scale vertically by resizing the EC2 instances.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache the static content.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Store the application's static content in Amazon S3.
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Storing static content in S3 and serving it through a CloudFront distribution reduces latency globally by offloading static assets to an object store and caching them at edge locations.
      Simply adding more EC2 instances, resizing instances, or moving code to Lambda does not address the global latency for static assets as effectively as using S3 + CloudFront.

    question: A company is developing a web application that allows its employees to upload a profile picture to a private Amazon S3 bucket. There is no size limit for the profile pictures, which should be displayed every time an employee logs in. For security reasons, the pictures cannot be publicly accessible. What is a viable long-term solution for this scenario?
    options:
     - text: Generate a presigned URL when a picture is uploaded. Save the URL in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Return the URL to the browser when the employee logs in.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Save the picture's S3 key in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint to allow the employees to download pictures once they log in.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Encode a picture using base64. Save the base64 string in an Amazon DB table. Allow the browser to retrieve the string and convert it to a picture.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Save the picture's S3 key in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use a function to generate a presigned URL every time an employee logs in. Return the URL to the browser.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Storing the S3 object key and using a VPC endpoint for S3 lets private, secure access to objects from within the VPC without making objects public, which is a scalable long-term solution.
      Saving presigned URLs on upload is insecure because they expire and can be leaked; storing base64 in a database is inefficient; generating presigned URLs per login is valid but adds overhead compared to using secure VPC access depending on the architecture.

    question: A Developer is going to deploy an AWS Lambda function that requires significant CPU utilization. Which approach will MINIMIZE the average runtime of the function?
    options:
     - text: Deploy the function into multiple AWS Regions.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the function into multiple Availability Zones.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the function using Lambda layers.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the function with its memory allocation set to the maximum amount.
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Increasing the function's memory allocation also increases the available CPU, so allocating the maximum memory will minimize average runtime for CPU-bound workloads.
      Deploying across regions or AZs or using layers does not change the function's CPU allocation; these options do not directly reduce runtime for CPU-heavy functions.

    question: A company has a legacy application that was migrated to a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application stores data in a MySQL database that is currently installed on a single EC2 instance. The company has decided to migrate the database from the EC2 instance to MySQL on Amazon RDS. What should the Developer do to update the application to support data storage in Amazon RDS?
    options:
     - text: Update the database connection parameters in the application to point to the new RDS instance.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Add a script to the EC2 instance that implements an AWS SDK for requesting database credentials.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create a new EC2 instance with an IAM role that allows access to the new RDS database.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create an AWS Lambda function that will route traffic, from the EC2 instance to the RDS database.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      The straightforward change is to update the application's database connection string to point to the new RDS endpoint and credentials so the app uses RDS for storage.
      Adding scripts, IAM roles on EC2, or Lambda routing are unnecessary; RDS is accessed via standard database connection parameters, not via EC2 IAM roles or custom routing functions.

    question: A Developer has an e-commerce API hosted on Amazon ECS. Variable and spiking demand on the application is causing order processing to take too long. The application processes Amazon SQS queues. The 'ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible' metric spikes at very high values throughout the day, which cause Amazon CloudWatch alarm breaches. Other ECS metrics for the API containers are well within limits. What can the Developer implement to improve performance while keeping costs low?
    options:
     - text: Target tracking scaling policy.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Docker Swarm.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Service scheduler.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Step scaling policy.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      A target tracking scaling policy that uses queue depth or a related metric can automatically scale the number of consumers to keep message backlog within targets while controlling costs.
      Docker Swarm, service scheduler, and step scaling are not the best cost-effective choices here; step scaling is more manual and Docker Swarm is a different orchestration tool rather than an autoscaling policy.

    question: A Developer wants to build an application that will allow new users to register and create new user accounts. The application must also allow users with social media accounts to log in using their social media credentials. Which AWS service or feature can be used to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: AWS IAM.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Amazon Cognito identity pools.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Amazon Cognito user pools.
       is_correct: true
     - text: AWS Directory Service.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Amazon Cognito user pools provide user management, sign-up/sign-in, and federation with social identity providers, which matches the requirements.
      IAM is for AWS resource access, identity pools are for temporary AWS credentials and do not provide user sign-up flows, and Directory Service is for AWS-managed directories rather than consumer-facing user registration.

    question: A company wants to implement authentication for its new REST service using Amazon API Gateway. To authenticate the calls, each request must include HTTP headers with a client ID and user ID. These credentials must be compared to authentication data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. What MUST the company do to implement this authentication in API Gateway?
    options:
     - text: Implement an AWS Lambda authorizer that references the DynamoDB authentication table.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Create a model that requires the credentials, then grant API Gateway access to the authentication table.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Modify the integration requests to require the credentials, then grant API Gateway access to the authentication table.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Implement an Amazon Cognito authorizer that references the DynamoDB authentication table.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      A Lambda authorizer can validate incoming headers by querying DynamoDB and return an IAM policy to API Gateway, enabling custom header-based authentication.
      API Gateway models and integration request changes alone cannot securely query DynamoDB for auth checks, and Cognito authorizers integrate with Cognito user pools rather than a custom DynamoDB table.

    question: A Developer is trying to make API calls using SDK. The IAM user credentials used by the application require multi-factor authentication for all API calls. Which method the Developer use to access the multi-factor authentication protected API?
    options:
     - text: GetFederationToken.
       is_correct: false

       is_correct: true
     - text: DecodeAutherizationMessage.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      The GetSessionToken API returns temporary credentials when MFA is required; clients use it to obtain session credentials that include MFA authentication.
      GetFederationToken and GetCallerIdentity are for different use cases, and DecodeAuthorizationMessage is for decoding encoded messages; none directly provide MFA-protected session credentials.

    question: An application is running on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. While trying to read objects stored within a single Amazon S3 bucket that are encrypted with server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS), the application receives the following error. Which combination of steps should be taken to prevent this failure? (Choose TWO)
    img: images/question212.jpg
    options:
     - text: Contact AWS Support to request an AWS KMS rate limit increase.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Perform error retries with exponential backoff in the application code.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Contact AWS Support to request a S3 rate limit increase.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Import a customer master key (CMK) with a larger key size.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use more than one customer master key (CMK) to encrypt S3 data.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      KMS has request rate limits; contacting AWS Support to increase KMS limits and adding retries with exponential backoff will mitigate throttling and transient failures.
      S3 rate limits, key size changes, or using multiple CMKs do not directly address KMS throttling and application retry behavior for SSE-KMS decryption errors.

    question: When developing an AWS Lambda function that processes Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Administrators within the company must receive a notice that includes the processed data. How should the Developer write the function to send processed data to the Administrators?
    options:
     - text: Separate the Lambda handler from the core logic.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to send the processed data.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Publish the processed data to an Amazon SNS topic.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Push the processed data to Amazon SQS.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Publishing processed data to an Amazon SNS topic allows administrators to receive notifications via multiple delivery protocols (email, SMS, etc.) and is suitable for alerting.
      Separating handler logic is a code structure recommendation, CloudWatch Events are for scheduling and events, and SQS is a queue rather than an immediate notification mechanism to administrators.

    question: A Developer is storing sensitive documents in Amazon S3 that will require encryption at rest. The encryption keys must be rotated annually, at least. What is the easiest way to achieve this?
    options:
     - text: Encrypt the data before sending it to Amazon S3.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Import a custom key into AWS KMS with annual rotation enabled.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS KMS with automatic key rotation.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Export a key from AWS KMS to encrypt the data.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      AWS KMS supports automatic key rotation for customer-managed CMKs, which is the simplest built-in way to ensure keys are rotated annually.
      Client-side encryption, importing custom keys, or exporting keys are more complex and do not offer the same simple automatic annual rotation as KMS-managed rotation.

       is_correct: false
     - text: Create an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to route API clients to the correct API version.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create an API Gateway resource policy to isolate versions and provide context to the Lambda function(s).
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the API versions as unique stages with unique endpoints and use stage variables to provide further context.
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Using API Gateway stages and stage variables gives unique endpoints for different versions and supports testing and configuration separation in a standard way.
      Versioning via custom headers or authorizers is less manageable; resource policies are for access control, not version routing.

     - text: Make an 'GenerateDataKey' API call that returns a plaintext key and an encrypted copy of a data key. Use a plaintext key to encrypt the data.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Make an 'GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext' API call that returns an encrypted copy of a data key. Use an encrypted key to encrypt the data.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Generating a data key with GenerateDataKey and using the plaintext data key locally to encrypt large objects is the recommended envelope encryption approach for large data.
      Encrypting large objects directly with the CMK via Encrypt is impractical due to size limits; GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext does not provide the plaintext key needed to perform local encryption.

      To access CodeCommit over HTTPS you create Git credentials generated via IAM for users, which allow HTTPS Git operations against CodeCommit.
      SSH keys are for SSH access, EC2 IAM roles are not used for user Git HTTPS authentication, and a GitHub token is unrelated to CodeCommit access.

       is_correct: true
     - text: Attaching an Elastic IP address to the instance in the private subnet.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      A NAT instance must have source/destination checks disabled so it can forward traffic for other instances; disabling this attribute allows NAT functionality.
      Adding ENIs or Elastic IPs to other instances is not the typical fix; the key required action is disabling source/destination checks on the NAT instance itself.

    question: You attempt to store an object in the 'US-STANDARD' region in Amazon S3, and receive a confirmation that it has been successfully stored. You then immediately make another API call and attempt to read this object. S3 tells you that the object does not exist. What could explain this behavior?
    options:
     - text: US-STANDARD uses eventual consistency and it can take time for an object to be readable in a bucket.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Objects in Amazon S3 do not become visible until they are replicated to a second region.
       is_correct: false

       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Historically, the US-Standard region exhibited eventual consistency for read-after-write for some operations, meaning an immediate read might not yet see the object.
      Objects do not need replication to another region to become visible, there is no fixed 1-second enforced delay, and bucket object limits do not cause immediate invisibility of newly stored objects.

      To avoid storing credentials on the instance you create an IAM role with appropriate DynamoDB permissions and launch the EC2 instance with that role so applications can assume the role.
      Creating IAM users or attempting to add users to running instances is not the recommended approach when preventing stored credentials on the instance; roles at launch time are the supported pattern.

       is_correct: false
     - text: Assign an Elastic IP address to the fourth instance.
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      If the instance lacks a public IP or Elastic IP, assigning an Elastic IP will make it reachable from the Internet using a public address.
      A NAT instance is for outbound traffic from private instances, modifying the routing table or host OS IP settings are unlikely if other instances with same setup already have internet access; the missing public IP is the common root cause.

    question: If a message is retrieved from a queue in Amazon SQS, how long is the message inaccessible to other users by default?
    options:
     - text: 0 seconds.
       is_correct: false
     - text: 1 hour.
       is_correct: false

       is_correct: false
     - text: 30 seconds.
       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      The default visibility timeout for SQS messages is 30 seconds, during which the message is hidden from other consumers after retrieval.
      Other durations such as 0 seconds, 1 hour, or permanent invisibility are not the default; visibility timeout can be changed but defaults to 30 seconds.

       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      SNS structured notification payloads are typically JSON objects that include fields like MessageId, Subject, Message, and unsubscribe URL where applicable.
      XML formats or incorrectly named JSON fields do not match the standard SNS structured message format used for many delivery types.

    question: When uploading an object, what request header can be explicitly specified in a request to Amazon S3 to encrypt object data when saved on the server side?
    options:

       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      The 'x-amz-server-side-encryption' header tells S3 to apply server-side encryption (such as AES256 or aws:kms) when storing the object.
      Other headers like storage class, Content-MD5, or security token do not request server-side encryption of the object.

       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Using Fn::GetAtt to retrieve the 'DNSName' attribute and joining it with the protocol returns the load balancer's URL in CloudFormation templates.
      Other variants reference non-existent attributes (like Url) or misuse Ref syntax; they will not reliably return the DNS name.

      By default CloudFormation rolls back and deletes resources created during a failed stack creation, terminating the process to leave no partial stack.
      It does not keep partially created resources by default, does not continue in a partial state, and templates are not guaranteed to succeed just by parsing.

      The EC2 API call 'DescribeImages' returns a list of AMIs and their attributes.
      'DescribeInstances' lists instances, 'DescribeAMIs' and 'GetAMIs' are not the standard API names in this context, and the claim about inability to retrieve AMIs is false.

       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Reducing the page size limits the amount of read throughput consumed per scan request, spreading load over time and reducing impact on provisioned capacity.
      Parallel scans increase throughput usage, and range indexes or prewarming do not directly reduce scan impact on provisioned throughput.

      Re-resolving DNS can avoid clients reusing a single ELB node, and using globally-distributed test clients ensures traffic comes from multiple network paths and IPs to exercise all backends.
      Changing regions for the single tester or altering stickiness settings without addressing DNS resolution or distribution of test clients will not reliably produce even load across servers.

Due to customer demand, they want to include an image for each bicycle along with the existing details. Which approach below provides the least impact to provisioned throughput on the 'Product' table?

       is_correct: true
    explanation: |
      Storing images in S3 and adding a pointer in DynamoDB keeps the table lightweight and minimizes provisioned throughput consumption.
      Storing binary image data directly in DynamoDB or creating extra tables increases read/write throughput demands and is less efficient than S3.

      Increasing the visibility timeout before processing gives the consumer time to complete work, and deleting the message afterwards ensures it is removed only after successful processing.

    explanation: |
      Using the office identifier as the hash key and name as the range key enables efficient queries confined to an office and filtered by name range, minimizing throughput usage.
      Hashing by name or omitting the appropriate range key would make the query inefficient and consume more provisioned throughput by scanning more data.

     - text: CloudFormation.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Simple Workflow Service.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Auto Scaling and CloudFormation are management services provided as part of the AWS platform that do not incur separate service charges beyond the resources they manage.
      Services like S3, EC2, ELB, and SWF may incur usage charges; they are not considered free of additional costs in the same way as the management features selected.
