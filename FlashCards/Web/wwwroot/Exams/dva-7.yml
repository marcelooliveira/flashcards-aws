    question: A company maintains a REST service using Amazon API Gateway and the API Gateway native API key validation. The company recently launched a new registration page, which allows users to sign up for the service. The registration page creates a new API key using 'CreateApiKey' and sends the new key to the user. When the user attempts to call the API using this key, the user receives a '403 Forbidden' error. Existing users are unaffected and can still call the API. What code updates will grant these new users access to the API?
    options:
     - text: The 'createDeployment' method must be called so the API can be redeployed to include the newly created API key.
       is_correct: false
     - text: The 'updateAuthorizer' method must be called to update the API's authorizer to include the newly created API key.
       is_correct: false
     - text: The 'importApiKeys' method must be called to import all newly created API keys into the current stage of the API.
       is_correct: false
     - text: The 'createUsagePlanKey' method must be called to associate the newly created API key with the correct usage plan.
