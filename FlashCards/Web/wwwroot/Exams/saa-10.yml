      A company is migrating its applications and databases to the AWS Cloud. The company will use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Direct Connect, and Amazon RDS. Which activities will be managed by the company's operational team? (Choose three.)
    options:
     - text: Configuration of additional software components on Amazon ECS for monitoring, patch management, log management, and host intrusion detection
       is_correct: true
     - text: Creation of an Amazon RDS DB instance and configuring the scheduled maintenance window
       is_correct: true
     - text: Encryption of the data that moves in transit through Direct Connect
       is_correct: true
     - text: Patching the underlying operating system of the RDS database instances.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Managing physical security of the Direct Connect edge locations.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Provisioning the hardware and virtualization layer for ECS clusters.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Under the Shared Responsibility Model, customers manage the configuration of software on top of ECS, the settings/maintenance windows of RDS, and the encryption of their data.
      Incorrect: 
        - AWS is responsible for patching the RDS OS, physical security of data centers/edge locations, and managing the underlying hardware and virtualization layers for ECS.

      A company needs to implement a solution to monitor the cost of its AWS accounts. The company needs to be alerted when the costs for a specific service exceed a predefined threshold.
    options:
     - text: Create a budget in AWS Budgets and set an alert based on the actual or forecasted cost.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use AWS Cost Explorer to manually export monthly reports and compare them to the budget.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Configure an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor the "EstimatedCharges" metric for the specific service.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Trusted Advisor to receive weekly notifications about cost optimization.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets that track your cost or usage and provides alerts via SNS or email when thresholds are breached.
      Incorrect: 
        - Cost Explorer is for visualization and manual analysis, not proactive alerting.
        - While CloudWatch can monitor total charges, it is less granular for service-specific thresholds compared to AWS Budgets.
        - Trusted Advisor provides cost-saving recommendations but is not a primary alerting tool for specific budget thresholds.

      A company is currently using a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection. The company’s average usage is 50 Mbps. The company wants to reduce its costs.
    options:
     - text: Work with an AWS Direct Connect Partner to order a smaller hosted connection.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use an AWS Site-to-Site VPN over the public internet and cancel the Direct Connect.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Configure a Transit Gateway to aggregate multiple small connections.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Purchase a Savings Plan for Direct Connect data transfer.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Moving from a dedicated 10 Gbps connection to a smaller "Hosted Connection" (e.g., 500 Mbps or 1 Gbps) through an AWS Partner significantly reduces the port hour costs.
      Incorrect: 
        - VPN may be cheaper, but it doesn't offer the consistent performance of Direct Connect if that is still a requirement.
        - Transit Gateway is a routing hub and does not directly reduce the cost of the underlying physical connection capacity.
        - Savings Plans do not apply to Direct Connect port hours or data transfer fees.

    question: |
      A company has multiple Windows file servers on premises. The company wants to migrate and consolidate its files into an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. File permissions must be preserved to ensure that access rights do not change. Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
    options:
     - text: Deploy AWS DataSync agents on premises. Schedule DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Order an AWS Snowcone device. Connect the device to the on-premises network. Launch AWS DataSync agents on the device. Schedule DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Map the on-premises drives to an Amazon S3 bucket using the S3 File Gateway and then move the data to FSx.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use the AWS CLI to copy files to S3, then use a Lambda function to move them to FSx.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Migration Hub to replicate the virtual machine disks directly into EBS volumes and then attach them to FSx.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: AWS DataSync is specifically designed to preserve metadata such as NTFS permissions (ACLs) when moving data to FSx. Snowcone supports DataSync for environments with limited bandwidth.
      Incorrect: 
        - Moving data through S3 or using CLI copies often strips NTFS-specific permissions unless complex workarounds are used.
        - Replicating disks (VM Import/Export) moves the whole OS, not just the files, and cannot be directly "attached" to an FSx managed service.
