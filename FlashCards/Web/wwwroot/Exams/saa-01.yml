    question: |
      A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
      The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.
      Which solution meets these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket to save storage costs.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use AWS DataSync to automate the transfer to the destination S3 bucket.
       is_correct: false  
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 
        General line- Collect huge amount of the files across multiple continents
        Conditions- High speed Internet connectivity
        Task- aggregate the data from all in a single S3 bucket
        Requirements- as quick as possible, minimize operational complexity
        S3 Transfer Acceleration because...
        ...ideally works with objects for long-distance transfer (uses Edge Locations)
        ...can speed up content transfers to and from S3 as much as 50-500%
        ...use cases- mobile & web application uploads and downloads, distributed office transfers, data exchange with trusted partners. Generally for sharing of large data sets between companies, customers can set up special access to their S3 buckets with accelerated uploads to speed data exchanges and the pace of innovation.
      Incorrect:
        Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket to save storage costs This approach introduces additional operational complexity and delays due to replication.
        Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use AWS DataSync to automate the transfer to the destination S3 bucket This solution is not suitable for high-speed internet connections and adds unnecessary steps.

    question: |
      A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
      What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use an Amazon API Gateway to serve both static and dynamic content.
       is_correct: false

    question: |
      A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
      The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
      Which solution will meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Deploy the database on Amazon RDS and enable Multi-AZ.
       is_correct: false

    question: |
      An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
      A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
      Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
    options:
     - text: Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use Amazon EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function when an image is uploaded.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to process the images.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the image processing workflow.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Store the compressed images in the same S3 bucket as the original images.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Using an SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send notifications to the queue allows for durable and scalable image processing tasks. EventBridge can trigger the Lambda function automatically, ensuring stateless processing.
      Incorrect:
        Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to process the images EC2 instances are not stateless and require more management compared to Lambda.
        Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the image processing workflow Step Functions add unnecessary complexity for this use case.
        Store the compressed images in the same S3 bucket as the original images This approach does not separate the original and processed images, which can lead to confusion and management challenges.

    question: |
      A company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.
      A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.
      Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
    options:
     - text: Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the inspection VPC.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Configure a NAT gateway to forward traffic to the inspection VPC.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy an additional firewall appliance in the public subnet of the application VPC.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Gateway Load Balancer and its endpoints allow for inline inspection of traffic from multiple VPCs, centralizing virtual appliances with minimal operational overhead.
      Incorrect:
        Use an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the inspection VPC ALB is not designed for traffic inspection and cannot integrate with third-party firewall appliances.
        Configure a NAT gateway to forward traffic to the inspection VPC NAT gateways are not intended for traffic inspection and cannot enforce security rules.
        Deploy an additional firewall appliance in the public subnet of the application VPC This approach increases operational overhead and does not centralize traffic inspection.

    question: |
      A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.
      A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.
      Which solution will meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use AWS DataSync to copy the data from the production environment to the test environment.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload the data to the bucket. Download the data to new EBS volumes in the test environment.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Backup to create backups of the production EBS volumes and restore them in the test environment.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: EBS fast snapshot restore enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation, eliminating latency and providing instant performance.
      Incorrect:
        Use AWS DataSync to copy the data from the production environment to the test environment DataSync is not optimized for cloning EBS volumes and may introduce additional latency.
        Create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload the data to the bucket. Download the data to new EBS volumes in the test environment This approach is inefficient and does not provide the required high I/O performance.
        Use AWS Backup to create backups of the production EBS volumes and restore them in the test environment AWS Backup does not offer the same speed and performance benefits as EBS fast snapshot restore.

       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the website and backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon S3.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: S3 and CloudFront provide high performance and scale for static content. API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB offer scalable, highly available backend APIs and data storage with minimal operational overhead.
      Incorrect: 
        - Using EC2 instances and RDS increases operational overhead due to the need for server management, scaling, and database maintenance.
        - Amazon Lightsail is designed for simpler workloads and does not scale as effectively for high traffic scenarios.

    question: |
      A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
      During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.
      Which solution will meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Increase the Lambda quotas further and integrate Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to buffer and process the data before loading it into the database.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use Amazon RDS Proxy to optimize and manage database connections between the Lambda function and the database.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the application on Amazon ECS with an Auto Scaling group to handle the high data volumes and database interactions.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Dividing the functionality into two Lambda functions, integrated by SQS, allows for independent scaling and efficient resource allocation, reducing the impact of high data volumes.
      Incorrect: 
        - Increasing Lambda quotas and using Kinesis adds complexity and does not minimize configuration effort compared to the SQS-based solution.

     - text: Store files in Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive and retrieve them as needed for long-term storage.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: S3 Intelligent-Tiering provides fast access for recent files, and S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is cost-effective for older files. Athena and Glacier Select enable querying as needed.
      Incorrect:
        - S3 Standard is more expensive for infrequently accessed files and does not optimize costs.
        - RDS is not cost-effective for storing large volumes of files.
        - Glacier Deep Archive has longer retrieval times, which is not suitable for files accessed within 1 year.

    question: |
      A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
      What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Manually SSH into each instance and apply the patch, ensuring all instances are updated.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to redeploy the application with the patched software for consistency.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Terminate all instances and relaunch them with the patched software to ensure a clean deployment.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Systems Manager Run Command allows you to quickly and securely run commands across a large fleet of EC2 instances for patching and remediation.
      Incorrect:
        - Manually SSHing into each instance is time-consuming and error-prone.
        - Elastic Beanstalk is not suitable for patching third-party software on existing EC2 instances.
        - Terminating and relaunching instances is disruptive and inefficient for applying patches.
