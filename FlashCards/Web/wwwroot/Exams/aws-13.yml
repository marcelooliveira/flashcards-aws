        is_correct: true
      - text: Software development
        is_correct: false

        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon EC2 with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
        is_correct: true
    explanation: EC2 with EBS allows stopping instances nightly while retaining data on EBS volumes. Instance store is ephemeral and would lose data; Redshift and DynamoDB are managed services not ideal for nightly stop maintenance use cases.

        is_correct: false
      - text: lower variable costs and lower upfront costs.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: AWS typically lowers both variable and upfront costs because of pay-as-you-go and economies of scale. Other choices mischaracterize the cost model.

        is_correct: false

      - text: Implementing Amazon Rekognition
        is_correct: false
      - text: Using AWS Shield-protected resources
        is_correct: false
      - text: Blocking access with Security Groups
        is_correct: false
      - text: Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
        is_correct: true
      - text: Enforcing password strength and expiration
        is_correct: true
    explanation: MFA and password policies secure IAM users; Rekognition, Shield and security groups are unrelated to IAM user authentication.

    question: What is one of the advantages of the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)?
    options:
      - text: It simplifies relational database administration tasks.
        is_correct: true
      - text: It provides 99.99999999999% reliability and durability.
        is_correct: false
      - text: It automatically scales databases for loads.
        is_correct: false
      - text: It enabled users to dynamically adjust CPU and RAM resources.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: RDS reduces administrative burden; exact durability percentages depend on configuration and are not guaranteed to the extreme shown. Some scaling can be automated but not always fully automatic.
