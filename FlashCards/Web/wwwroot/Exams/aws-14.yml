    explanation: |
        To use Amazon EC2, you simply:
        Select a pre-configured, templated Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to get up and running immediately. Or create an AMI containing your applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings.
        Configure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.
        Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.
        Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.
        Pay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.

    question: How would an AWS customer easily apply common access controls to a large set of users?
    options:
      - text: Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Apply the same IAM policy to all IAM users with access to the same workload.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.).
        Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
        That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

    question: Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
    options:
      - text: Implement single points of failure.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Implement loose coupling.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Implement monolithic design.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Implement vertical scaling.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.
        The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.
        This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.
        So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

    question: Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Select TWO.)
    options:
      - text: Enable AWS CloudTrail.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Enable Amazon CloudFront.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: |
        If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.
        This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.
        For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.

    question: Which service provides a hybrid storage service that enables on-premises applications to seamlessly use cloud storage?
    options:
      - text: Amazon Glacier

      - text: AWS Snowball
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Storage Gateway
        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS)
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases.        These include moving tape backups to the cloud, reducing on-premises storage with cloud-backed file shares, providing low latency access to data in AWS for on- premises applications, as well as various migration, archiving,    processing, and disaster recovery use cases.

    question: Which of the following is an important architectural design principle when designing cloud applications?
    options:
      - text: Use multiple Availability Zones.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Use tightly coupled components.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Use open source software.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Provision extra capacity.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        Data Center resilience is practiced through Availability Zones across data centers that reduce the impact of failures.
        Fault isolation improvement can be made to traditional horizontal scaling by sharding (a method of grouping instances into groups called shards, instead of sending the traffic from all users to every node like in the traditional IT structure.)

      - text: Amazon SQS
        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon ElastiCache
        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon EC2 Instance Store
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a great choice for implementing a highly available, distributed, and secure in-memory cache to decrease access latency, increase throughput, and ease the load off your relational or NoSQL databases and applications.
        ElastiCache can serve frequently requested items at sub- millisecond response times, and enables you to easily scale for higher loads without growing the costlier backend databases.
        Database query results caching, persistent session caching, and full-page caching are all popular examples of caching with ElastiCache for Redis.

        is_correct: true
    explanation: |
        Of course, Amazon is responsible for auditing physical data center assets and resources since it is the property of Amazon Inc. Customers have no access to physical sites, hence they are not responsible for maintaining physical data center assets.

      - text: Elastic Load Balancing
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
        You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
        You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications.
        You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC.
        For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access.
        You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.
