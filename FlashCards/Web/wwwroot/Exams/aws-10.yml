    question: Which of the following can an AWS customer use to launch a new Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster? (Select TWO)
    options:
      - text: AWS Concierge.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS CloudFormation.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Management Console.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: AWS CloudFormation and AWS Management Console are the correct ways to launch RDS clusters. AWS Concierge provides support recommendations but cannot launch resources. Amazon S3 is object storage unrelated to RDS deployment. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling manages EC2 instances, not RDS clusters.

    question: Which of the following Reserved Instance (RI) pricing models provides the highest average savings compared to On-Demand pricing?
    options:
      - text: One-year, No Upfront, Standard RI pricing.
        is_correct: false
      - text: One-year, All Upfront, Convertible RI pricing.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Three-year, All Upfront, Standard RI pricing.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Three-year, No Upfront, Convertible RI pricing.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Three-year all-upfront standard RIs offer the highest discount because customers commit for the longest term with immediate payment. One-year commitments provide less savings than three-year. No Upfront options cost more than All Upfront. Convertible RIs have lower discount rates than Standard RIs.

      - text: Real-time monitoring.
        is_correct: true

        is_correct: true
    explanation: CloudWatch Logs provides real-time monitoring and adjustable retention policies. SNS summaries are not built-in. Free Elasticsearch analytics is not included—that would require separate service. CloudWatch Logs charges are based on data ingested and stored, not free.

        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon Aurora.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS Lambda is a fully managed serverless compute service. Amazon SWF is a workflow service, not compute. Amazon EC2 requires customer management of instances. Amazon Aurora is a database service, not compute.

        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS CodeCommit.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS Lambda enables serverless execution without managing servers. EC2 requires provisioning and managing virtual machines. DynamoDB is a database service, not for code execution. CodeCommit is a version control service, not for running code.

    question: According to the AWS shared responsibility model who is responsible for configuration management?
    options:
      - text: It is solely the responsibility of the customer.
        is_correct: false
      - text: It is solely the responsibility of AWS.
        is_correct: false

        is_correct: true
      - text: It is not part of the AWS shared responsibility model.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Configuration management is a shared responsibility where AWS manages AWS service configuration and customers manage their application and resource configurations. It cannot be solely one party's responsibility, and it is definitely part of the shared responsibility model.

      - text: Planned.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Variable cost.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: AWS uses pay-as-you-go pricing with variable costs based on usage. There are no fixed-term requirements (though Reserved Instances are optional). Colocation refers to physical data center models. Planned pricing implies fixed costs upfront.

        is_correct: false
      - text: Ensuring that hardware is disposed of properly.
        is_correct: false

    question: A customer is using multiple AWS accounts with separate billing. How can the customer take advantage of volume discounts with minimal impact to the AWS resources?
    options:
      - text: Create one global AWS account and move all AWS resources to that account.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Sign up for three years of Reserved Instance pricing up front.

        is_correct: true
      - text: Sign up for the AWS Enterprise support plan to get volume discounts.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS Organizations consolidated billing pools usage across accounts for volume discounts without consolidating resources. Moving all resources to one account risks availability and governance. Reserved Instances are separate from volume discounts. Support plans don't provide volume discounts.

        is_correct: true
      - text: No Upfront Reserved Instances for a 3 year term.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Three-year all-upfront RIs offer the steepest discount. One-year terms provide smaller discounts. Partial or No Upfront options have higher effective costs than All Upfront.

        is_correct: true

        is_correct: false

    question: Which service stores objects, provides real-time access to those objects, and offers versioning and lifecycle capabilities?
    options:
      - text: Amazon Glacier.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Storage Gateway.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon S3.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon EBS.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: S3 stores objects with real-time access, versioning, and lifecycle management. Glacier is for archive storage with slow retrieval. Storage Gateway bridges on-premises and AWS. EBS provides block storage.

    question: Distributing workloads across multiple Availability Zones supports which cloud architecture design principle?
    options:
      - text: Implement automation.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Design for agility.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Design for failure.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Implement elasticity.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Multi-AZ distribution designs for failure by isolating failures to single zones. Automation is separate. Agility refers to rapid changes. Elasticity is about scaling.
