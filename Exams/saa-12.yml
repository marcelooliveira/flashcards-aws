  question: |
    A company has a financial application that produces reports (avg 50 KB). Reports are frequently accessed during the first week and must be stored for several years. They must be retrievable within 6 hours. 
    Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
  options:
    - text: Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use S3 Standard-IA for the entire duration of storage.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automate all transitions.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use S3 Standard. Use a lifecycle rule to transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: S3 Standard is best for the first week of frequent access. Transitioning to Glacier after 7 days minimizes costs for long-term storage. The 6-hour retrieval requirement is met by Glacier Flexible Retrieval (standard retrieval is 3-5 hours).
    Incorrect: 
    - Standard-IA has a minimum storage duration of 30 days and a minimum object size of 128KB; 50KB files would be billed at 128KB.
    - Deep Archive retrieval takes 12-48 hours, failing the 6-hour requirement.

      is_correct: false
    - text: Set up a Route 53 Latency routing policy.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use a Weighted routing policy.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use a Geolocation routing policy.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Latency routing directs users to the endpoint that provides the lowest round-trip time, which directly addresses the requirement to "minimize load time."
    Incorrect: Geolocation routes based on the user's origin (e.g., all users in France), but the nearest server physically isn't always the fastest path over the internet.

    A company has 5 PB of tape data and a 1 Gbps internet link. They must migrate to AWS within 6 months and keep data for 10 years.
    Which solution is most cost-effective?
  options:
    - text: Transfer the data over the internet to S3 Standard.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use AWS DataSync to move tapes to S3.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use multiple AWS Snowball Edge devices with Tape Gateway. Move to S3 Glacier Deep Archive via lifecycle policy.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Ship the physical tapes to an AWS data center for manual upload.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: 5 PB would take over a year to upload on a 1 Gbps link (assuming 100% utilization). Snowball Edge with Tape Gateway allows for offline migration of bulk data. Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest storage class for 10-year retention.

    A company plans to run parallel data processing on EC2. Nodes must NOT share the same underlying hardware.
    Which networking solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Run the EC2 instances in a spread placement group.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Run the EC2 instances in a cluster placement group.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use a Partition placement group.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use a dedicated host for every instance.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: A Spread Placement Group ensures that each instance is placed on a distinct rack, each with its own network and power source.
    Incorrect: Cluster placement groups do the opposite—they put instances close together on the same hardware to minimize latency.

    A DR strategy requires guaranteed EC2 capacity in a failover Region.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Use an ASG with a target tracking policy.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Purchase Scheduled Reserved Instances.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Purchase an On-Demand Capacity Reservation in the failover Region.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Rely on the failover Region's default capacity.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Capacity Reservations ensure that you can launch the needed number of instances in a specific AZ, even during a large-scale regional outage where others might be competing for resources.

    An R&D business is splitting from its parent company and needs its own organization. A new management account is created.
    What is the next step?
  options:
    - text: Move the R&D OU directly to the new management account.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Invite the R&D account to the new organization after it has left the old one.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use the AWS Resource Access Manager to share the accounts.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Delete the old organization and recreate it.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: An AWS account can only belong to one Organization at a time. The account must first be removed from the original organization (becoming a standalone account) before it can accept an invite to a new one.

    A solution must capture unpredictable, high-volume web activity for analytics, include an authorization step, and integrate with other apps.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: S3 with Lambda triggers.
      is_correct: false
    - text: EC2 instances behind an NLB.
      is_correct: false
    - text: API Gateway with a Lambda authorizer, integrated with Kinesis Data Firehose, storing to S3.
      is_correct: true
    - text: CloudFront with a signed URL.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: API Gateway provides the managed endpoint and the "Lambda Authorizer" for security. Kinesis Firehose handles the "unpredictable/sudden" scale of streaming data and delivers it to S3 for processing.

    An ecommerce company needs a DR solution for SQL Server with an RPO/RTO of 24 hours.
    Which solution is most cost-effective?
  options:
    - text: Set up a Cross-Region Read Replica.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use a Multi-AZ deployment.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Copy automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS).
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Since the RPO (data loss) allows for 24 hours, copying snapshots once a day is the cheapest option. It avoids the costs of running an active database or high-speed replication in another region.

    A web app uses sticky sessions and hosts session state on the web server. 
    How can high availability be ensured without losing session state during an outage?
  options:
    - text: Increase the session timeout on the ALB.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use EBS Provisioned IOPS for the web servers.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use an SQS queue to buffer user requests.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Offloading session state to an external cache (Redis) makes the web servers stateless. If one server fails, the user is routed to another server which can still retrieve the session from Redis.

      is_correct: true
    - text: Vertically scale the instance size once a month.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Multi-AZ for the database.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Enable DynamoDB Accelerator.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Read Replicas are designed exactly for this: offloading read-heavy reporting workloads from the primary database to ensure the primary's performance is not degraded.

  question: |
    A company runs a container application on Amazon EKS. The app includes microservices for customers and orders. They need to route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices most cost-effectively.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for every microservice.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use the AWS Load Balancer Controller to provision an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use an Amazon EC2 instance running NGINX as a proxy.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon API Gateway to route traffic to the EKS nodes.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: The AWS Load Balancer Controller manages ALBs that can handle "Ingress" resources in Kubernetes. This allows a single ALB to route traffic to multiple microservices based on paths (e.g., /orders or /customers), which is much more cost-effective than a separate load balancer for every service.
    Incorrect: NLBs are more expensive for path-based routing at scale, and a manual NGINX setup increases operational overhead.

    A company sells access to copyrighted images globally. They need low-latency access, the ability to deny specific countries, and minimal costs.
    Which solution meets these requirements?
  options:
    - text: Use S3 with Cross-Region Replication to all regions.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use an EC2 Fleet with a custom Geo-IP database.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon S3 to store images. Use Amazon CloudFront with geographic restrictions and signed URLs.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use AWS Global Accelerator in front of an ALB.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: CloudFront caches images at edge locations for low latency. Geographic restrictions (Geo-blocking) allow blocking specific countries at the edge. Signed URLs ensure only paying customers access the content. This is the most cost-effective global delivery model.
    Incorrect: Replicating S3 buckets globally is extremely expensive due to storage and transfer costs.

    A solutions architect needs a highly available ElastiCache for Redis solution. It must provide high availability at the node and Region level, ensuring no data loss or performance degradation during failures.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Use Multi-AZ Redis replication groups with shards that contain multiple nodes.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use a single-node Redis cluster with daily snapshots to S3.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Global Datastore for Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon Memcached with auto-discovery.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Multi-AZ with Replication Groups provides automatic failover if a primary node fails. Using shards with multiple nodes ensures that even if a node in a shard fails, others are available, maintaining performance and data integrity.
    Incorrect: Snapshots don't provide high availability. Global Datastore provides cross-region replication but is often used for Disaster Recovery rather than local Region HA.

  question: |
    An application takes a long time to launch and load memory. How can the company reduce launch time during the next testing phase?
  options:
    - text: Use a larger EC2 instance type.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Provisioned IOPS EBS volumes.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Launch instances with hibernation turned on and configure EC2 Auto Scaling warm pools.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use Amazon CloudFront to cache the application code.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Hibernation saves the RAM state to the EBS volume. Combined with "Warm Pools," which keep a set of instances in a "Stopped" or "Hibernated" state, the application can start significantly faster because the memory-intensive initialization is already done.
    Incorrect: Larger instances or faster disks don't solve the "loading time" of the application software itself as effectively as resuming from a pre-initialized state.

    An application experiences sudden traffic increases on random days. What is the most cost-effective way to maintain performance?
  options:
    - text: Provision the maximum capacity required to handle peaks at all times.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use scheduled scaling to increase capacity every morning.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use dynamic scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use a Compute Savings Plan.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Dynamic scaling (Target Tracking or Step Scaling) reacts to real-time metrics (like CPU or request count). This ensures the company only pays for the capacity they need when the "random" spikes occur.
    Incorrect: Since the spikes are on random days, scheduled scaling is not effective.

    An ecommerce app uses PostgreSQL on EC2. Unpredictable monthly sales events cause connection issues.
    Which is the most cost-effective way to maintain performance?
  options:
    - text: Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use a larger EC2 instance for the database.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Add a Read Replica to the EC2 database.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use ElastiCache in front of the EC2 instance.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Aurora Serverless v2 scales capacity (ACUs) instantly and automatically in response to demand. For unpredictable sales events, it ensures the database doesn't crash from connections while minimizing costs during quiet periods.
    Incorrect: Scaling an EC2 instance requires downtime and manual intervention.

    A serverless application has high latency when employees start using it at the beginning of each day.
    Which solution reduces this latency?
  options:
    - text: Increase the memory of the Lambda function to 10GB.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Set up scheduled scaling to increase Lambda Provisioned Concurrency before the work day begins.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use an API Gateway Regional endpoint instead of Edge-optimized.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Migrate the Lambda function to an EC2 instance.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: High latency at the start of the day is a "cold start" issue. Provisioned Concurrency keeps a specified number of functions "warm" and ready. Scaling this up on a schedule (e.g., at 8:00 AM) ensures users have no latency when they start work.

    Research devices generate .csv files on an SMB share. Analysts need to run SQL queries periodically throughout the day.
    Which combination meets this cost-effectively? (Choose three.)
  options:
    - text: Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon S3 File Gateway mode.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use Amazon Redshift to store and query the data.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the S3 data.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use Amazon RDS for MySQL to store the data.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Migrate all data to Amazon EFS.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Set up Amazon Athena to query the data in S3.
      is_correct: true
  explanation: |
    Correct: S3 File Gateway allows local SMB devices to write directly to S3. Glue Crawlers define the schema for the CSV files. Athena allows the analysts to run SQL queries directly on S3 without the cost of a running database (pay-per-query).
    Incorrect: Redshift and RDS would be much more expensive for "periodic" queries as they charge for hourly instance uptime.

      is_correct: true
    - text: Replacing failed power supply units in the Outposts rack.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: Under the Shared Responsibility Model for AWS Outposts, the customer is responsible for the physical environment (Power, Cooling, Physical Security) and the network connection back to AWS.
    Incorrect: AWS is responsible for managing the hardware, patching the hypervisor, and replacing failed physical components.

    A TCP-based application needs to process 3 million requests per second with low latency on a nonstandard port in AWS.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and configure it for the required TCP port.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon CloudFront to terminate the TCP connections.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Use Amazon API Gateway with a VPC Link.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: NLBs operate at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and are specifically built to handle tens of millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency. They support any TCP port.
    Incorrect: ALBs are for Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and have higher latency/lower throughput compared to NLBs for raw TCP traffic.
