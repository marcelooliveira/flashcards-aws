      A company has a financial application that produces reports. The reports average 50 KB in size and are stored in Amazon S3. The reports are frequently accessed during the first week after production and must be stored for several years. The reports must be retrievable within 6 hours.
    options:
     - text: Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Store the reports directly in S3 Glacier Deep Archive and use expedited retrievals when needed.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically manage the transitions between all tiers.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is ideal for data that is accessed infrequently but can wait a few hours (1-5 hours) for retrieval. Transitioning after the first week of frequent access minimizes costs for multi-year storage.
      Incorrect: 
        - S3 Standard-IA has a minimum storage duration of 30 days and a minimum object size of 128 KB for billing; 50 KB objects would be billed at 128 KB, making it less cost-effective than Glacier.
        - S3 Glacier Deep Archive has a minimum retrieval time of 12 hours, which violates the 6-hour requirement.
        - Intelligent-Tiering has a monthly monitoring fee per object, which can be expensive for a large volume of small (50 KB) files.

      A company needs to optimize the cost of its Amazon EC2 instances. The company also needs to change the type and family of its EC2 instances every 2-3 months.
    options:
     - text: Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Purchase EC2 Instance Savings Plans for the specific instance families currently in use.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use Standard Reserved Instances with a 3-year term for maximum discount.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Purchase Convertible Reserved Instances and exchange them every 2 months.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility. They apply to usage across any instance family, size, region, or even Fargate and Lambda. This is perfect for a company that changes instance types frequently.
      Incorrect: 
        - EC2 Instance Savings Plans are locked to a specific instance family in a specific region.
        - Standard Reserved Instances do not allow changing instance families.
        - While Convertible RIs allow family changes, they involve more manual management (exchanges) compared to the automatic application of Compute Savings Plans.

      A company wants to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters and Amazon RDS DB instances to build and run a payment processing application. The company will run the application in its on-premises data center for compliance purposes.
    options:
     - text: Use AWS Outposts to run the ECS cluster and RDS instances locally in the data center.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Set up an AWS Site-to-Site VPN and run the ECS tasks on-premises using ECS Anywhere.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Deploy the application on a VMware cluster and use the AWS Management Console to manage it via AWS Systems Manager.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use AWS Snowball Edge devices to host the RDS database and ECS services permanently.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any data center or co-location space. It supports both ECS and RDS, satisfying the compliance need for local residency.
      Incorrect: 
        - ECS Anywhere allows running ECS tasks on-premises, but it does not provide a managed RDS service for on-premises hardware.
        - Systems Manager is for management/patching, not for providing the underlying compute and database service equivalent to ECS and RDS.
        - Snowball Edge is primarily for data migration or edge computing in disconnected environments, not for permanent, high-availability payment processing applications.

    question: |
      A company is planning to migrate a TCP-based application into the company's VPC. The application is publicly accessible on a nonstandard TCP port through a hardware appliance in the company's data center. This public endpoint can process up to 3 million requests per second with low latency. The company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS.
    options:
     - text: Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and use a Listener for the specific TCP port.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Use Amazon Route 53 with a Multivalue answer routing policy to point directly to the EC2 instances.
       is_correct: false
     - text: Configure an API Gateway with a TCP Private Link to the backend services.
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct: The Network Load Balancer (NLB) is designed to handle tens of millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. It operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), making it ideal for non-standard TCP ports and high-throughput requirements.
      Incorrect: 
        - ALBs operate at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and are not optimized for raw TCP performance at the scale of 3 million requests per second compared to NLB.
        - Route 53 pointing to instances does not provide the same level of sophisticated health checking, instant scaling, or a single static IP address (via Elastic IP) that an NLB provides.
        - API Gateway is for REST/WebSocket/HTTP APIs and would introduce significant latency and cost for 3 million TCP requests per second.
