    question: How can a company reduce its Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) using AWS?
    options:
      - text: By minimizing large capital expenditures.
        is_correct: true
      - text: By having no responsibility for third-party license costs.
        is_correct: false
      - text: By having no operational expenditures.
        is_correct: false
      - text: By having AWS manage applications.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Using AWS allows companies to shift from large up-front capital expenditures to pay-as-you-go operational costs, lowering TCO. The incorrect options are wrong because AWS does not remove responsibility for third-party license costs (customers still manage licenses), it does not eliminate all operational expenditures (you still pay for services), and AWS does not manage customers' application logic by default (customers manage their apps unless using a managed service with specific responsibilities).

    question: Which options does AWS make available for customers who want to learn about security in the cloud in an instructor-led setting? (Select TWO)
    options:
      - text: AWS Trusted Advisor.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Online Tech Talks.
        is_correct: true

        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Forums.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Classroom Training.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: AWS Online Tech Talks and AWS Classroom Training provide instructor-led or live training options. The wrong options are incorrect because Trusted Advisor is an advisory service, the AWS Blog is self-paced reading, and AWS Forums are community Q&A rather than instructor-led training.

    question: Which of the following will enhance the security of access to the AWS Management Console’? (Select TWO)
    options:
      - text: AWS Secrets Manager.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Certificate Manager.
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA).
        is_correct: true
      - text: Security groups.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Password policies.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: Enabling MFA and enforcing strong password policies improve console access security. The other options are wrong because Secrets Manager stores secrets for applications, Certificate Manager manages TLS certificates, and Security Groups control network traffic, not console authentication.

      - text: Subnets.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Elastic Load Balancing.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: VPC dashboard lets you configure security groups and subnets. The wrong answers are services managed outside VPC dashboard; CloudFront is a CDN, Route 53 is DNS, and ELB is managed in the EC2/Load Balancer consoles.

        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS CloudTrail Logs.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS is solely responsible for physical security of data centers. The incorrect options are customer responsibilities or shared tasks; IAM policies, S3 bucket policies, and CloudTrail configuration are managed by the customer.

        is_correct: true
      - text: Service limits increasing by default in all accounts.
        is_correct: false

        is_correct: false

        is_correct: true
      - text: The automatic extension of the master account’s AWS support plan to all accounts.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Consolidated billing produces a single bill and can enable volume discounts by aggregating usage. The wrong answers are incorrect because service limits don't automatically increase, there is no fixed discount guaranteed, and support plans do not automatically extend to member accounts.

        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS managed services like RDS can automate patching and backups. The other tasks are typically customer responsibilities; testing app releases, schema design, and penetration testing are customer activities.

        is_correct: false
      - text: Move an Availability Zone to the new Region.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Begin deploying resources in the second Region.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Download the AWS Management Console for the new Region.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: To use a new region, you simply deploy resources there. The wrong options are incorrect; no new contract is usually required, AZs cannot be moved between regions, and the console is the same—no download needed.

        is_correct: false
      - text: They are capable of handling constant changes in network traffic patterns.
        is_correct: true
      - text: They automatically adjust capacity. They are provided at no charge to users.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: ELBs help distribute traffic and handle changing traffic patterns. The wrong options are incorrect; the first two are nonsensical conversions, and ELBs are not free and don’t 'auto-adjust capacity' in the sense of provisioning compute—they distribute traffic across instances.

      - text: Amazon EC2 Instance Store.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Amazon S3 offers durable, cost-effective storage with immediate retrieval. Glacier is cheaper but has slower retrieval. EBS is block storage for instances and can be more costly. EC2 instance store is ephemeral and not durable.

    question: A company needs 24/7 phone email and chat access with a response time of less than 1 hour if a production system has a service interruption Which AWS Support plan meets these requirements at the LOWEST cost?

        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon Inspector.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: AWS Config tracks configuration changes over time. Trusted Advisor gives best practice recommendations, CloudWatch monitors metrics and logs, and Inspector scans for vulnerabilities; none provide the same change-audit capability.

      - text: It provides a list of cost optimization recommendations based on current AWS usage.

        is_correct: false
      - text: It provides proactive alerting whenever an Amazon EC2 instance has been compromised.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Trusted Advisor offers cost optimization and security permission checks. It does not find application-level software vulnerabilities (that's Inspector), it does not auto-correct issues, and it doesn't provide intrusion alerts for EC2 (that's CloudWatch/GuardDuty).

        is_correct: false
      - text: Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
        is_correct: true

    question: What is an advantage of deploying an application across multiple Availability Zones?
    options:
      - text: There is a lower risk of service failure if a natural disaster causes a service disruption in a given AWS Region.
        is_correct: false
      - text: The application will have higher availability because it can withstand a service disruption in one Availability Zone.
        is_correct: true
      - text: There will be better coverage as Availability Zones are geographical^ distant and can serve a wider area.
        is_correct: false
      - text: There will be decreased application latency that will improve the user experience.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Deploying across AZs improves availability and resilience to single-AZ failures. The wrong choices are incorrect because regions (not AZs) provide broad geographic separation, latency improvements depend on region placement, and AZs are within a region so natural disasters affecting entire region are not addressed.

        is_correct: true
    explanation: Spot Instances can offer steep discounts (often up to 90%) but can be interrupted. Reserved Instances provide discounts but not typically that high; On-Demand has no discount; Dedicated Hosts are about isolation, not extreme discounts.
