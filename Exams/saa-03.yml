    question: |
      A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.
      What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?
    options:
     - text: Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Creating three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ, ensures high availability and fault tolerance. Each private subnet can route traffic through its respective NAT gateway to access the internet for software updates.

    question: |
      A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.
      Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)
    options:
     - text: Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Launching the EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system ensures low-latency access. Installing an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center automates the data transfer process to AWS.

    question: |
      A company has an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data during each run.
      What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data?
    options:
     - text: Edit the job to use job bookmarks.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Job bookmarks in AWS Glue track the state of the data that has been processed. By enabling job bookmarks, AWS Glue can process only new data added to the S3 bucket, avoiding reprocessing of old data.

    question: |
      A company is preparing to deploy a new serverless workload. A solutions architect must use the principle of least privilege to configure permissions that will be used to run an AWS Lambda function. An Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule will invoke the function.
      Which solution meets these requirements?

    question: |
      A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability to delete the objects.
      What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Enabling S3 Object Lock and versioning ensures that objects remain immutable until a legal hold is removed. Adding the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to specific IAM policies restricts deletion capabilities to authorized users.

    question: |
      A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website.
      The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally efficient process for image uploads.
      Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
    options:
     - text: Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.
       is_correct: true
     - text: Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Uploading original images directly to Amazon S3 reduces the load on the web server. Using S3 Event Notifications to invoke a Lambda function for image resizing decouples the processing logic and improves performance.

      A company uses 50 TB of data for reporting. The company wants to move this data from on premises to AWS. A custom application in the company’s data center runs a weekly data transformation job. The company plans to pause the application until the data transfer is complete and needs to begin the transfer process as soon as possible.
      The data center does not have any available network bandwidth for additional workloads. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud.
      Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

      A company has created an image analysis application in which users can upload photos and add photo frames to their images. The users upload images and metadata to indicate which photo frames they want to add to their images. The application uses a single Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon DynamoDB to store the metadata.
      The application is becoming more popular, and the number of users is increasing. The company expects the number of concurrent users to vary significantly depending on the time of day and day of week. The company must ensure that the application can scale to meet the needs of the growing user base.

      A medical records company is hosting an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet, but they do not require any other network access.
      A new requirement mandates that the network traffic for file transfers take a private route and not be sent over the internet.
      Which change to the network architecture should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
    options:
     - text: Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:

      A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization increases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms.
      What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
    options:
     - text: Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.
       is_correct: true
     - text: "***replace later***"
       is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      Correct:
        Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms allow you to combine multiple alarm conditions, such as CPU utilization and disk IOPS, into a single alarm. This reduces false alarms and ensures that actions are taken only when both conditions are met.
      Incorrect: 
        "***replace later***"
