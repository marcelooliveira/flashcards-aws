  question: |
    A company needs an S3 storage strategy: 
    - 0-180 days: Readily available.
    - 180-360 days: Infrequently accessed.
    - 360+ days: Archived but must be available INSTANTLY.
    - 5+ years: Audits only (12-hour retrieval ok).
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: S3 Standard -> S3 One Zone-IA -> S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval -> S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
      is_correct: false
    - text: S3 Standard -> S3 Standard-IA -> S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval -> S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
      is_correct: false
    - text: S3 Standard -> S3 Standard-IA -> S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval -> S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
      is_correct: true
    - text: S3 Standard -> S3 Intelligent-Tiering -> S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: S3 Standard-IA provides high durability across multiple AZs for the first transition. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is the ONLY archive tier that provides "instant" (millisecond) access. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest tier for the final 5-year audit requirement where 12-hour retrieval is acceptable.
    Incorrect: One Zone-IA lacks durability. Glacier Flexible Retrieval takes minutes to hours, failing the "instant" requirement.

  question: |
    A company has a critical data workload running 6 hours daily on Amazon EMR. Data loss is not allowed. 
    Which EMR configuration is most cost-effective?
  options:
    - text: Persistent cluster with all On-Demand Instances.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Transient cluster with primary/core nodes on On-Demand and task nodes on Spot Instances.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Transient cluster with all Spot Instances.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Persistent cluster using Reserved Instances.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: A "Transient" cluster shuts down after the job, saving money. Keeping Primary and Core nodes on On-Demand ensures the cluster doesn't fail (data integrity), while using Spot Instances for "Task" nodes (which don't store HDFS data) provides significant savings.

  question: |
    A company needs to automatically tag all resources in a specific account with a "Cost Center ID" based on an RDS database mapping of the user who created them.
    Which solution meets this?
  options:
    - text: Use a Service Control Policy (SCP) to deny resource creation without tags.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Create a Lambda function triggered by EventBridge (via CloudTrail) to tag resources based on the RDS DB.
      is_correct: true
    - text: Use AWS Config rules to flag untagged resources.
      is_correct: false
    - text: Create an IAM policy that forces tagging.
      is_correct: false
  explanation: |
    Correct: This is a classic automation pattern. CloudTrail captures the "Create" event, EventBridge triggers Lambda, and Lambda lookups the Cost Center in RDS and applies the tag to the resource ARN.
