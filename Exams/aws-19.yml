    options:

        is_correct: false

    explanation: |
      The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) instances within the AWS cloud.
      AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for some applications and data subject to contractual or regulatory mandates for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection may be necessary.
      CloudHSM complements existing data protection solutions and allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs that are designed and validated to government standards for secure key management.
      CloudHSM allows you to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that keys are accessible only by you.

    question: Which AWS service is suitable for an event-driven workload?
    options:
      - text: Amazon EC2
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS Lambda
        is_correct: true
      - text: Amazon Lumberyard
        is_correct: false
    explanation: |
      easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and web services developed in a number of programming languages.
      You can configure event notifications for your Elastic Beanstalk environment so that notable events can be automatically published to an SNS topic, then pushed to topic subscribers.
      an example, you may use this event-driven architecture to coordinate your continuous integration pipeline (such as Jenkins CI).
      That way, whenever an environment is created, Elastic Beanstalk publishes this event to an SNS topic, which triggers a subscribing Lambda function, which then kicks off a CI job against your newly created Elastic Beanstalk environment.
