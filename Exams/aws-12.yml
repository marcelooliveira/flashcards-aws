    question: Which of the following components of the AWS Global Infrastructure consists of one or more discrete data centers interconnected through low latency links?
    options:
      - text: Availability Zone
        is_correct: true
      - text: Edge location
        is_correct: false
      - text: Region
        is_correct: false
      - text: Private networking
        is_correct: false
    explanation: An Availability Zone consists of one or more discrete data centers interconnected with low-latency links. Edge locations are CDN endpoints; regions are geographic groupings of AZs; private networking is not an infrastructure component in this sense. The wrong options are incorrect because Regions encompass AZs, edge locations are separate CDN caches, and private networking is a networking concept rather than a physical infrastructure unit.

    question: One benefit of On-Demand Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) pricing is
    options:
      - text: The ability to bid for a lower hourly cost.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Paying a daily rate regardless of time used.
        is_correct: false
      - text: Paying only for time used.
        is_correct: true
      - text: Pre-paying for instances and paying a lower hourly rate.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: On-Demand pricing charges for compute by the time used with no long-term commitment. Bidding is for Spot, daily rates are not standard, and pre-paying for lower hourly rates applies to Reserved Instances.

        is_correct: false
    explanation: Professional Services and APN partners can assist with migration evaluation. Trusted Advisor provides optimization checks, Systems Manager manages operations, and Secrets Manager stores secrets; these are not primary migration evaluation tools.

        is_correct: false
      - text: Refresh data changes daily.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Edge locations (CloudFront) cache content and reduce latency. They don't host generic EC2 for customers or guarantee caching of frequently changing data without origin reach; refresh schedules vary by cache settings.

        is_correct: false

        is_correct: false
      - text: AWS manages user applications in the AWS Cloud.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: A key value of AWS is pay-as-you-go with no long-term contract required. AWS shares security responsibilities with customers; servers can be provisioned in minutes rather than days; AWS does not manage customers' applications unless they use specific managed services.

    question: A company is migrating an application that is running non-interruptible workloads for a three-year time frame. Which pricing construct would provide the MOST cost-effective solution?

      - text: Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.
        is_correct: false

        is_correct: false
      - text: Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances.
        is_correct: true
    explanation: Reserved Instances (or Savings Plans) are best for predictable, long-term, non-interruptible workloads. Spot is interruptible; Dedicated Instances focus on tenancy; On-Demand is costlier for long-term use.

        is_correct: false
      - text: High availability.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Global reach (multiple regions and edge locations) reduces latency for global users. Fault tolerance and high availability improve resilience but not necessarily global latency. Pay-as-you-go is a pricing model.

        is_correct: true
      - text: AWS takes care of application security patching.

      - text: In AWS Config, create a custom rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function to review firewall rules for inbound access.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Trusted Advisor provides direct checks for security groups allowing open access; manually checking each SG is time-consuming, IAM console doesn't show SG rules, and creating custom Config rules is more effort than using Trusted Advisor.

    question: How do Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups help achieve high availability for a web application?
    options:
      - text: They automatically add more instances across multiple AWS Regions based on global demand of the application.
        is_correct: false
      - text: They automatically add or replace instances across multiple Availability Zones when the application needs it.
        is_correct: true
      - text: They enable the application’s stalk; content to reside closer to end users.
        is_correct: false
      - text: They are able to distribute incoming requests across a tier of web server instances.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: Auto Scaling manages instances across AZs for availability and replacement; it doesn't automatically provision across regions by default or distribute requests (that's ELB's role).

        is_correct: true
      - text: Security Groups.
        is_correct: false
    explanation: IAM policies restrict S3 bucket access to specific principals. Key-pairs are for EC2 SSH, Inspector is a vulnerability service, and Security Groups are network-level controls.

        is_correct: false
      - text: Users do not need to address security and compliance issues.
        is_correct: false
